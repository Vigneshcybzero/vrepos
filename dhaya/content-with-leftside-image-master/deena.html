    You may come across these options in the wild, but they are generally frowned upon, as they make updating websites cumbersome and unwieldy.

                        Another CSS property used for layout is float. Float is intended for wrapping text around images..

            </div><aside class="sidebar">In this case, the section element is actually after the div. 
                    However, since the div is floated to the left, this is what happens: the text in the section is floated around the div and the section surrounds the whole thing. 
                    What if we wanted the section to actually appear after the floated element?
