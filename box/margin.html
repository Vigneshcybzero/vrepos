        we should talk about width's big caveat: the box model. When you set the width of an element, the element can actually appear bigger than what you set: the element's border and padding will stretch out the element beyond the specified width. Look at the following example, 
        where two elements with the same width value end up different sizes in the result.
    This is Big... Before HTML 4 and CSS, very few HTML elements supported both border and padding, 
        so the definition of the width and height of an element was not very contentious. However, it varied depending on the element. The HTML width attribute of a table defined the width of the table including its border.[5] On the other hand, the HTML width attribute of an image defined the width of the image itself (inside any border).[6] The only element to support padding in those early days was the table cell.
         Width for the cell was defined as "the suggested width for a cell content in pixels excluding the cell padding."
